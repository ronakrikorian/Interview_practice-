# Interview_practice-
This is a test for my interview 

Hw1 is from a class called Robotic Planning and Estimation, the first part of the course consisted of principles used to design planning and estimation algorithms for robots. These algorithms form the basis of artificial intelligence and control theory, and find application in a variety of emerging technologies and disciplines. The second half introduced probabilistic techniques used in robot localization and map building. The course had a strong focus on algorithms, going over the modeling, design, algorithm, and computational issues that arise when devising planning and estimation algorithms.

Interview practice was a short program I created to recall python techniques and to illustrate my understanding of a small portion of what Trufl does.
